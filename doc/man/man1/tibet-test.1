.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Runs unit, functional, and/or integration tests on your application\.
.P
CLI\-initiated tests are run in the context of phantomjs and support
.br
the use of the full TIBET test harness and UI driver feature set\.
.P
The default operation makes use of ~app_test/phantom\.xml as the
.br
boot\.profile (which controls what code is loaded) and a TSH shell
.br
command of ':test' which will run all test suites in the profile\.
.P
You can specify a particular test target object or test suite to
.br
run as the first argument to the command\. If you need to specify
.br
both a target and suite use \-\-target and \-\-suite respectively\.
.P
You can limit testing to a particular case or set of cases by using
.br
the \-\-cases parameter\. Both \-\-suite and \-\-cases accept either a string
.br
or a regular expression in JavaScript syntax such as \-\-cases="/foo/i"\.
.P
Output is to the terminal in colorized TAP format by default\.
.br
Future versions will support additional test output formatters\.
.P
You can use the built\-in debugging facilities of PhantomJS by
.br
specifying \-\-remote\-debug\-port and a port number\.
