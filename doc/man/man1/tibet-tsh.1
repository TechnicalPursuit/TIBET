.SH "NAME"
\fBtibet-tsh\fR \- runs a TIBET Shell (TSH) expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
tibet tsh [\-\-script=]<command> [<phantomtsh_args>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Runs the TIBET \fBphantomtsh\fP script runner to execute a TSH script\.
.P
The script to execute is presumed to be the first argument, quoted as
needed to ensure that it can be captured as a single string to pass to
the TIBET Shell\. For example: \fBtibet tsh ':echo "Hello World!"'\.\fP
You can also use the \fB\-\-script\fP argument to provide the TSH script\.
.P
\fB<phantomtsh_args>\fP refers to the various flags and paramters you can
provide to TIBET's \fBphantomtsh\.js\fP script\. See \fBtibet help phantomtsh\fP\|\.

.SS Run a more complex TSH script via the command line
.P
In the example below we run the TSH \fB:test\fP command via the \fBtsh\fP command line
tool\. As it turns out, this is exactly what the \fBtibet test\fP command does\. The
\fBtibet test\fP command is actually a subtype of the \fBtsh\fP command\.
