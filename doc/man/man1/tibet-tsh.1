the TIBET Shell\. For example: \fBtibet tsh ':echo "Hello World!"'\.\fP
You can also use the \fB\-\-script\fP argument to provide the TSH script\.
.P
\fB<headless_args>\fP refers to the various flags and paramters you can
provide to Headless Chrome\.

.SS Run a more complex TSH script via the command line
.P
In the example below we run the TSH \fB:test\fP command via the \fBtsh\fP command line
tool\. As it turns out, this is exactly what the \fBtibet test\fP command does\. The
\fBtibet test\fP command is actually a subtype of the \fBtsh\fP command\.

$ tibet tsh \-\-script ':test'
