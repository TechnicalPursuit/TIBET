.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
TIBET projects include a manifest file named \fB{appname}\.appcache\fP which is
.br
managed by this command\. Specific comment blocks in TIBET versions of the
.br
manifest file help delimit the content of the file for easier processing\.
.P
Content checks are done against the files in \fB~app_build\fP and \fB~lib_build\fP\|\.
.br
If your application caches files outside of those directories you
.br
must add those entries manually\. \fIThis command never removes entries\fR so
.br
you can feel confident both editing the cache and using this command\.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-file\fP :
.br
Provides a way to point to an application manifest other than
.br
\fB{appname}\.appcache\fP\|\. You will need this if you renamed the default app manifest
.br
file\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-enable\fP :
.br
Update \fBindex\.html\fP to use the proper manifest value\. When active the html
.br
element will have a \fBmanifest\fP attribute, otherwise it will have a \fBno\-manifest\fP
.br
attribute (which effectively turns off caching)\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-disable\fP :
.br
Update \fBindex\.html\fP to have a \fBno\-manifest\fP attribute\. This attribute name
.br
effectively will disable the cache\. \fINOTE that if the cache was ever activated
.br
you must clear your browser's cache content and any browser\-specific appcache
.br
(chrome://appcache\-internals/) to fully disable\.\fR
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-develop\fP :
.br
Update the cache such that application file content is commented out so it
.br
will load dynamically via the network\. Invert the flag via \fB\-\-no\-develop\fP to
.br
uncomment application section content to test your application running from the
.br
cache\. Note \fB\-\-develop\fP is on by default\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-missing\fP :
.br
List files in the application not in the manifest\. This is a relatively
.br
simple scan looking for css, image, and other non\-source files which might be
.br
useful to cache\. For JavaScript the system presumes that only source files in
.br
\fB~app_build\fP should be part of the cache\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-rebuild\fP :
.br
Refresh the app and lib sections of the manifest\. This is the only flag
.br
which edits the file content of the appcache itself\. If the comment delimiters
.br
for app and lib sections are not present this operation will fail and output an
.br
appropriate error message\. Use this option with a degree of caution since it
.br
will alter the content of your cache\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-touch\fP : Update the embedded ID: {timestamp} value provided by the
.br
default cache template\. This effectively changes the cache content which
.br
should have the effect of causing your browser to refresh the cache\.
