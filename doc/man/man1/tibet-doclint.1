.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Runs the TSH \fB:doclint\fP command to validate method comment content\.
.P
The doclint command uses TIBET reflection to find all methods in your
.br
application and check their comment text for conformance to JSDoc3 and
.br
TIBET comment standards\. This check can be a part of an overall quality
.br
pass which includes running \fBtibet lint\fP and \fBtibet test\fP on your code\.
.P
If you provide an optional string parameter it will be used as a filter
.br
for filenames\. Using a string which begins and ends with / will cause the
.br
pattern to be treated as a regular expression for testing purposes\.
.P
Note that because it uses method reflection, not file lists, to drive
.br
the checks when this command outputs file counts they represent the
.br
number of unique files containing matching methods, not a full list
.br
of project files\. This can be disconcerting at first if you are used
.br
to listings which are built by file\-driven tools\.
