.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Outputs a list of package assets either as asset nodes or asset paths\.
.P
This command is a useful way to view the files which a \fBtibet rollup\fP or
.br
\fBtibet lint\fP command will process\. The best way to get a sense of this
.br
command is to run it with various options, of which there are many:
.P
\-\-package    the file path to the package to process\.
.br
\-\-config     the name of an individual config to process\.
.br
\-\-all        process all config tags in the package recursively\.
.br
\-\-missing    output a list of missing assets of all types\.
.P
\-\-include    a space\-separated list of asset tags to include\.
.br
\-\-exclude    a space\-separated list of asset tags to include\.
.P
\-\-nodes      output asset nodes rather than asset paths\.
.br
\-\-phase      boot phase subset to process <all | one | two | app | lib>\|\.
.P
\-\-images     include all image assets\.
.br
\-\-scripts    include all JavaScript source\-containing assets\.
.br
\-\-styles     include all CSS containing assets\.
