.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Outputs a list of package assets either as asset nodes or asset paths\.
.P
This command is a useful way to view the files TIBET will load or process
via commands such as \fBtibet rollup\fP or \fBtibet lint\fP\|\. The best way to get a sense
of this command is to run it with various options, of which there are many\.
.P
You generally don't need to run this command yourself, most operations around
packaging, rollups, minification, etc\. are managed by the various \fBtibet make\fP
targets which support \fBbuild\fP operations in various forms\. See the files in your
project's \fB~app_cmd/make\fP directory for specifics\.
.P
The underlying machinery of the \fBpackage\fP command is shared by a number of other
TIBET commands, all of which leverage TIBET's application package/config files\.
This includes the \fBrollup\fP, \fBresources\fP, and \fBlint\fP commands as well as any
command line which launches TIBET headlessly to leverage reflection\.
.P
Note that this command can also take a set of open\-ended options that correspond
to config 'boot\.' properties\. So, for instance, '\-\-boot\.minified=false' can be
supplied on the command line and this will set the appropriate boot property\.
