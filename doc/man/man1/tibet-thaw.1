.SH "NAME"
\fBtibet-thaw\fR \- thaws a frozen project's TIBET library reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBtibet thaw [\-\-force]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
NOTE: this command will be removed in a future release once splitting
of the TIBET npm package into \fBtibet\-cli\fP and \fBtibet\fP is complete\.
.P
Thaws (un\-freezes) the current application's TIBET library in \fB~app_inf\fP\|\.
.P
By default \fB~app_inf\fP refers to \fBpublic/TIBET\-INF\fP, the default location for
package data, custom commands, etc\. TIBET is configured to allow a version of
TIBET to be frozen into \fB~app_inf/tibet\fP rather than in \fBnode_modules/tibet\fP to
support deployments where the use of the \fBnode_modules\fP directory would be
unnecessary or excessive\.
.P
The thaw command removes any \fB~app_inf/tibet\fP content and returns the
setting for \fBlib_root\fP to its default value of \fB~/node_modules/tibet\fP where the
\fB~\fP in this case represents your project's root directory\.
.P
Since it is inherently destructive this command requires \fB\-\-force\fP to
actually run\.
