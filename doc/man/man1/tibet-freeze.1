.SH "NAME"
\fBtibet-freeze\fR \- freezes the current project's TIBET library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBtibet freeze [\-\-tibet <bundle>] [\-\-force] [\-\-minify] [\-\-all]
    [\-\-standalone] [\-\-source] [\-\-zipped] [\-\-brotlied]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
NOTE: this command will be removed in a future release once splitting
of the TIBET npm package into \fBtibet\-cli\fP and \fBtibet\fP is complete\.
.P
Freezes the current application's TIBET library in \fB~app_inf\fP by copying the
current TIBET library code to \fB~app_inf/tibet\fP rather than using a link\.
.P
By default \fB~app_inf\fP refers to \fBTIBET\-INF\fP, the default location for
package data, custom commands, etc\. TIBET is configured to allow
a version of TIBET to be frozen into \fBTIBET\-INF/tibet\fP rather than
in \fBnode_modules/tibet\fP to support deployments where the use of the
\fBnode_modules\fP directory would be unnecessary or excessive\.
.P
Flags allow you to control the scope of what is frozen\. Since the
freeze command is only concerned with the TIBET library these flags
focus on whether you want minified TIBET bundles, all TIBET bundles,
raw source for dynamic development, or some combination of those\.
.P
Using \fBtibet freeze\fP without parameters will freeze the current copy
of \fBtibet_base\.min\.js\fP along with the load and hook files needed to boot\.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-tibet\fP :
Takes a bundle name minus any \fBtibet_\fP prefix For example, \fB\-\-tibet full\fP
will freeze the \fBtibet_full\fP bundle\. This flag defaults to the value \fBbase\fP so
\fBtibet_base\fP is frozen\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-force\fP :
Required to actually cause a freeze operation to be performed when the
project is already frozen\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\fP :
Overrides any filtering of bundle content and preserves all bundles of TIBET
source found in the \fB~lib_build\fP directory\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-minify\fP :
Controls whether you freeze minified source code and is used in conjunction
with the \fB\-\-tibet\fP flag to filter bundles\. The default value is true, so only
minified code is frozen by default\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-source\fP :
Causes the current TIBET source tree to be copied into the target directory\.
This option supports dynamic development with TIBET source code but does have a
performance impact\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-standalone\fP :
Packages a completely standalone environment that will allow an application
to use not only TIBET client code, but TDS server and TIBET CLI code all bundled
within a standalone package\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-zipped\fP :
Controls whether zipped copies are preserved or pruned\. This flag works
after any minify processing so if you set both minify and zipped you will retain
\fB\|\.min\.js\.gz\fP files\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-brotlied\fP :
Controls whether brotlied copies are preserved or pruned\. This flag works
after any minify processing so if you set both minify and brotlied you will
retain \fB\|\.min\.js\.br\fP files\.
