.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Freezes the current application's TIBET library in \fB~app_inf\fP\|\.
.P
By default \fB~app_inf\fP refers to \fBTIBET\-INF\fP, the default location for
.br
package data, custom commands, etc\. TIBET is configured to allow
.br
a version of TIBET to be frozen into \fBTIBET\-INF/tibet\fP rather than
.br
in \fBnode_modules/tibet\fP to support deployments where the use of the
.br
\fBnode_modules\fP directory would be unnecessary or excessive\.
.P
Flags allow you to control the scope of what is frozen\. Since the
.br
freeze command is only concerned with the TIBET library these flags
.br
focus on whether you want minified TIBET bundles, all TIBET bundles,
.br
raw source for dynamic development, or some combination of those\.
.P
Using \fBtibet freeze\fP without parameters will freeze the current copy
.br
of \fBtibet_base\.min\.js\fP along with the load and hook files needed to boot\.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-tibet\fP :
.br
Takes a bundle name minus any \fBtibet_\fP prefix For example, \fB\-\-tibet full\fP
.br
will freeze the \fBtibet_full\fP bundle\. This flag defaults to the value \fBbase\fP so
.br
\fBtibet_base\fP is frozen\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-link\fP :
.br
Attempt to use symbolic links rather than a full recursive copy\. This is
.br
useful if you are working with a live TIBET installation and need a frozen
.br
structure to boot properly but do not want to have your library code truly
.br
frozen for development\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-minify\fP :
.br
Controls whether you freeze minified source code and is used in conjunction
.br
with the \fB\-\-tibet\fP flag to filter bundles\. The default value is true, so only
.br
minified code is frozen by default\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-zipped\fP :
.br
Controls whether zipped copies are preserved or pruned\. This flag works
.br
after any minify processing so if you set both minify and zipped you will retain
.br
\fB\|\.min\.js\.gz\fP files\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\fP :
.br
Overrides any filtering of bundle content and preserves all bundles of TIBET
.br
source found in the \fB~lib_build\fP directory\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-raw\fP :
.br
Causes the current TIBET source tree to be copied into the target directory\.
.br
This option supports dynamic development with TIBET source code but does have a
.br
performance impact\.
