.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Runs a target function in a TIBET \fBmakefile\.js\fP file via a JS Promise\.
.P
This command supports lightweight commands in the form of functions, much
.br
like Grunt or Gulp\. There's no dependency checking or true 'make'\-like
.br
functionality but \fBmakefile\.js\fP code does leverage JavaScript Promises to
.br
coordinate tasks and their interactions, particularly when calling tasks
.br
within tasks and when dealing with asynchronous tasks\.
