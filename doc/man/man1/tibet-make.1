.SH "NAME"
\fBtibet-make\fR \- runs a function as a task
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBtibet make <target> [\-\-list] [\-\-private] [\-\-timeout <ms>] [\-\-stack]
    [\-\-brotli] [\-\-zip]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This command runs lightweight commands in the form of functions, much like Grunt
or Gulp\. There's no dependency checking or true 'make'\-like functionality but
\fBtibet make\fP does leverage JavaScript Promises to coordinate tasks and their
interactions, particularly when calling nested or asynchronous tasks\.
.P
TIBET provides a set of default functions for \fBmake\fP which support basic
operations such as \fBclean\fP, \fBbuild\fP, and \fBrollup\fP that are common in TIBET
applications\. By providing these commands as make targets it's easy for you to
modify them to meet your specific project requirements\.
.P
When you use the \fBtibet\fP command all available make targets are checked if no
concrete command is found\. For example, you can run \fBtibet clean\fP and, since
there is no concrete \fBclean\fP command the \fBtibet\fP command will delegate to the
\fBtibet make clean\fP operation\.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-list\fP :
Used to list the available \fBtibet make\fP targets you can run\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-private\fP :
Tells the \fB\-\-list\fP operation to also include private tasks, tasks whose
names begin with \fB_\fP so they are normally filtered by the list option\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-stack\fP :
Tells the task machinery to print an output of the stack if it errors\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-timeout <ms>\fP :
Gives you a way to provide a millisecond timeout value in which each task
must complete successfully\. The default is 15 seconds (15000)\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-brotli\fP :
Whether or not to generate brotli\-compressed packages of JavaScript code\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-zip\fP :
Whether or not to generate gzip\-compressed packages of JavaScript code\.
