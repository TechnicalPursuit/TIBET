\fBtibet-user\fR \- adds/updates user configuration data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBtibet user <username> <password> [\-\-env <env>]
    [\-\-role <role|roles>] [\-\-org <org|orgs>] [\-\-unit unit]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
!!! NOTE: this command and the file(s) it manages are NOT SECURE and should
never be used in production\. This command is provided for convenience to let you
simulate users, roles, orgs, and units during development only\. !!!
.P
Manages and/or displays current TIBET user configuration data in the form of a
user file and one or more associated vcards, one per username\.
.P
This command lets you add, or update user data stored in \fB~user_file\fP (usually
\fBusers\.json\fP) such that the resulting data will work properly with default
lightweight authentication logic from the TDS\.
.P
When you add a new user that user will have a vcard generated for them and
stored in \fB~app_dat/{username}_vcard\.xml\fP\|\. If you specify an existing user that
user's vcard is updated with any new data provided\.
.P
A user's vcard is sent to the client by the TDS in response to requests when
that user logs in, providing the client with role, org, and unit data\.
.P
NOTE that if you use this command to set values it will rewrite the user file by
using the beautify npm module to process the stringified JSON content\. As a
result your file may not retain its appearance after updates\.
