Welcome to TIBET! This quickstart content is intended to get you up and running
with a minimum of overhead so we'll be working with a limited set of commands
and using their default options\. Once you're done, check out the documentation
at https://www\.technicalpursuit\.com/docs/index\.html to dive deeper into TIBET\.

CREATE A NEW PROJECT

The 'tibet clone' command is your first step in creating a TIBET project\.

Before using clone navigate to a directory to hold your new project content
and select a name for your new project\. The name will be used as a directory
name so it should be a valid directory name on your platform\.

Type 'tibet clone {appname}', replacing {appname} with your project name:

    $ tibet clone test
    TIBET dna 'default' cloned to test as app 'test'\.

INITIALIZE THE PROJECT

With your new project in place you need to initialize it to install any code
dependencies specific to the template you cloned (we used the default here)\.
Navigate to your project and then type 'tibet init' to initialize it:

    $ cd test
    $ tibet init
    Initializing new default project\.\.\.
    installing project dependencies via `npm install`\.
    Project initialized successfully\.

START THE DEMO SERVER

The 'default' template used by clone includes a simple Node\.js\-based HTTP
server we call the TIBET Data Server or TDS\. By default the TDS will use
port 1407 so assuming that port isn't busy on your system you can start the
server using 'tibet start' without any parameters:

    $ tibet start
    Starting server at http://127\.0\.0\.1:1407/index\.html

Congratulations! Your new TIBET project is running\. Open the web address
for your project in an HTML5 browser and you should see text directing you
on how to take the next step in your TIBET journey\.
