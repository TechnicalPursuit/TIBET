/*
The elements of this file are focused on code and content import. Of
particular interest are the elements that support TIBET's type and method
"autoloader" capability which allows code to be dynamically loaded without
programmer intervention. This is a powerful feature since it means you can
tune your load packages to create a smaller startup footprint, migrating
features among various packages without having to alter source code that
consumes those resources. Mention a type or method and TIBET will autoload
it if it's not yet available. All that's required is current metadata so
TIBET knows where to find the various types/methods you will want to load.
This metadata is constructed automatically during application execution, you
simply save it from the development environment and you're ready to go.

TP.sys.defineMethod('importPackage',

    /**
     * @method importPackage
     * @summary Optionally imports a package and target by name. No attempt to
     *     manage inter-package dependencies is made. Using the shouldReload
     *     flag allows you to force reloading of package content when a
     *     particular package has already been loaded. NOTE that you can not
     *     reload the Kernel package.
     * @summary This method is a useful way to load code from a package
     *     target. To assist with determining whether a particular target has
     *     already been loaded the target will default to 'base' during the test
     *     phase. This is the typical core target and using base also avoids
     *     issues with nested target references which are common with the full
     *     target. If the full target is found in the load record it is assumed
     *     that all other targets have been loaded. If no target was specified
     *     and neither the base or full target appear to have been loaded the
     *     package will be imported using whatever target was specified, or the
     *     package's default target.
     * @param {String} aPackageName The package name to locate and import as
     *     needed. The package's XML configuration file is presumed to live in
     *     the TIBET configuration directory or in the boot dir of the
     *     application itself. Prefix this name with an appropriate ~ path as
     *     needed to ensure app vs. lib resolution. Default is
     *     ~lib_cfg/[aPackageName].xml.
     * @param {String} aTarget The target name to load. Default is whatever is
     *     listed as the default for that package (usually base).
     * @param {String|TP.core.URI} aBaseDir The base directory to use for
     *     resolving file paths. Normally you should leave this null.
     * @param {Boolean} shouldReload True if the package should be reloaded if
     *     already loaded. The default is false. Note that when you force reload
     *     of a package that package's script elements are reloaded as well.
     * @param {Boolean} loadSync Should the load be done synchronously? Default
     *     is true.
     * @returns {Number} The number of unique nodes loaded from the package
     *     during the import process.
