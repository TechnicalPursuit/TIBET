# Installation

#### To Install TIBET via Docker <a href="#dockerinstall">see the Docker instructions</a>.

#### Check TIBET's <a href="#prereqs">prerequisites</a> first.

We recommend using `nvm` to install Node.js v8+. You can confirm your nvm, node, and npm versions using:

```
nvm --version
nvm v0.5.0

node --version
v8.11.1

npm --version
5.6.0
```

If you are missing TIBET's node/npm <a href="#prereqs">prerequisites</a> install those first.


#### Installing TIBET via `npm`

TIBET should be installed globally using `npm install -g`:<br/>

```bash
npm install -g tibet
```

And TIBET's developer dependencies:

```bash
$(npm root -g)/tibet/bin/tibet_develop_init.bash
```


Initial installation process can take several minutes depending on the speed of
your network connection and the particular version being installed. Be patient
:).

**Once your installation completes check out the <a href="https://www.technicalpursuit.com/docs/quickstart.html">TIBET Quickstart Guide</a>.**

#### Installing TIBET via `git`

If you prefer to install via `git` see the <a href="#gitinstall">TIBET Git
Installation</a> instructions.

#### Command Line

Use `tibet help` for more information on the TIBET CLI and the available command
set for your version, or check out the full <a
href="https://www.technicalpursuit.com/docs/cli.html">TIBET CLI</a> documentation.

#### API Docs

##### `tibet reflect`

API documentation is generated for your TIBET version via `tibet reflect` at
the command line and via `:reflect` from within the <a
href="https://www.technicalpursuit.com/docs/tsh.html">TIBET Shell</a>. TIBET's `reflect` options can output type
lists, method lists, or individual object documentation.

##### `tibet apropos`

To explore TIBET functionality use the `tibet apropos` command
or `:apropos` from the <a
href="https://www.technicalpursuit.com/docs/tsh.html">TIBET Shell</a>. The `apropos` feature scans method names and
comments for matching terms, letting you search TIBET for functionality that
relates to a topic.

# Prerequisites

#### Install Node.js

TIBET requires Node.js version 8+

We also recommend using `npm` version `5.x` or higher.

**We strongly recommend you use the Node Version Manager (`nvm`)** to manage
your Node.js installation. Using `nvm` lets you install multiple versions of
Node.js and switch between them with ease which is great for development and
helpful if you need to adjust the version running in production while
maintaining an easy rollback strategy.

To install Node.js via `nvm` see the instructions at <a
href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">the nvm GitHub repo</a>.

To install Node.js without `nvm` follow the instructions at <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>.

#### Update/Adjust npm

If you already have a recent version of Node.js installed you should have a
valid version of `npm`. We suggest using at least npm `3.x`. The latest
versions of npm `5.x` also appear stable.

```
npm install -g npm@3

# OR

npm install -g npm@5
```

If you see errors from any npm-based operations mentioning `cb() never called!`
you'll want to perform the step above, or the appropriate step for your
operating system. See <a
href="https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm">this npm troubleshooting topic</a> for more.

<img alt="Install via Docker" src="./lib/media/docker_logo.jpg" width="152px" height="128px"/>

<a name="dockerinstall" href="#"></a>
# Installing TIBET via Docker

Running TIBET via Docker is very easy. TIBET Docker container images exist on
DockerHub and are prebuilt for ease of development.

##### First, install the Docker software for your machine.

To install Docker, follow the instructions at <a href="https://docs.docker.com">Docker Documentation</a>

##### Then, install the TIBET Docker image from Dockerhub

```
docker pull technicalpursuit/tibet
```

Note that, this will pull the latest TIBET release (by default `docker pull`
will pull the tag with the `:latest` tag). Therefore, the following is
equivalent:

```
docker pull technicalpursuit/tibet:latest
```

Team TIBET follows a 'semver' release versioning scheme. You could also pull any
one of the following:

```
docker pull technicalpursuit/tibet:5
OR
docker pull technicalpursuit/tibet:5.0
OR
docker pull technicalpursuit/tibet:5.0.0
```

##### Instantiate a Docker container from the TIBET Docker image

Create a Docker container and execute it by running the TIBET Docker image. Note
that, inside of the TIBET Docker container, port 1407 (the traditional TIBET
port) is exposed. To execute the environment and expose the port into your host
environment, execute the following:

```
docker run -i -p 127.0.0.1:1407:1407/tcp -t technicalpursuit/tibet
```

You are now inside of the Docker environment, inside of the home directory of
the 'developer' user that the TIBET Docker image created for you, ready to start
TIBET development!

After you create your TIBET project and build it (see instructions later on how
to do that), you can access the TIBET Data Server running in your Docker
container by going to this address in a browser in your host environment:

```
http://127.0.0.01:1407
```

***NOTE*** Be aware that Docker does **NOT** preserve the environment after you
exit the container (by executing `exit` from the shell). Any work you've done in
the container will be lost!!!

Therefore, you need to use Docker to either mount a volume or use bind mounts to
persistent your TIBET project. Follow the instructions at <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">Docker Volumes</a> and
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/">Docker Bind Mounts</a>

# Installing TIBET via Git

If you prefer working from a git repository you can install TIBET via git. This
approach can take a fair amount of time depending on connection and machine
speed since you'll need to download all of TIBET's dependencies and build them
locally.

##### First, uninstall any npm-installed version of TIBET

If you have already installed TIBET via npm you need to first remove that
installation to avoid conflicts with your Git-based installation:

```bash
npm uninstall -g tibet
```

##### Create a Fork

If you are going to install TIBET via Git we recommend that you first create a
fork of TIBET so you can manage updates in a stable, predictable fashion.

Follow these instructions to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">create
your own fork</a>.

##### Clone your Fork

```bash
git clone {{your_fork_repo_url}}
```

##### Initialize your Fork

Once your fork has been cloned move into the new fork directory and install the
package dependencies:

```bash
cd {{your_fork_repo_directory}}
npm install .
```

##### Link TIBET via npm

With your fork initialized you'll need to link the repository via `npm link` so
that the `tibet` command will function. From the top of your TIBET fork type:

```bash
npm link .
```
<br/>
You should now be able to use the `tibet` command which lets you run `tibet
build`.

##### Build TIBET Dependencies and Packages

When working with a `git`-based repository you'll need to rebuild TIBET packages
and dependencies, depending on your individual project launch configuration.

To build the full set of TIBET dependencies and launch packages use:

```
tibet build_all
```

NOTE: the above command can take _quite some time_ depending on your network
connection, machine performance, etc. since it's building a large set of
dependent modules in addition to TIBET itself.

With TIBET cloned, initialized, linked, and built you're ready to rock.
