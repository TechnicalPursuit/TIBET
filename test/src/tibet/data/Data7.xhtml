    <h2>Data Test #7</h2><br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    This test sets up a &lt;tibet:data&gt; tag that makes data in the page available as under a particular named URI. It has 'makestructures' set to 'true' so that when a 'set' is executed against the data that it is holding and there is no existing 'structure' for that data, that it is auto-created.
    <br/>
    In this test, there is no pre-existing structure at all, which tests 'multi-level' structure building from a root.
    <br/>
    A variety of signals are thrown by the various objects involved.
