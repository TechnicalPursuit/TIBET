    <h2>Group Test #5</h2><br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This test sets up 2 'tibet:group' elements, both that, although they enclose a set of descendant elements, also have an explicit query that will associate elements in the document with that group.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Elements that are members of the 'fooGroup' group will have their borders turned black, those that are members of the 'gooGroup' group will have their borders turned blue.
    <br/>
    <!-- Since this element is not empty, its 'context' is itself. Since a query is specified, only elements that match it *and that are under it* (because its the context) are considered part of the group. -->
    <tibet:group id="fooGroup" query="#bar &gt; #onlyThing">
        <div id="foo">This is the foo div. It is not in any group.</div>
        <div id="bar">This is the bar div. It is not in any group.
            <div id="onlyThing">This is the onlyThing div. It is in the 'fooGroup' group.
            </div>
        </div>
    </tibet:group>

    <!-- Since this element is not empty, its 'context' is itself. Since a query is specified, only elements that match it *and that are under it* (because its the context) are considered part of the group. This means that all of its descendants will match, but '#baz' won't because its not under the group element itself. -->
    <tibet:group id="gooGroup" query="*, #baz">
        <div id="gar">This is the gar div. It is in the 'gooGroup' group.</div>
        <div id="gaz">This is the gaz div. It is in the 'gooGroup' group.</div>
    </tibet:group>

    <div id="baz">This is the baz div. It is not in any group.</div>
