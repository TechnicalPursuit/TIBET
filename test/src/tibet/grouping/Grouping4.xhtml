    <h2>Group Test #4</h2><br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This test sets up 3 'tibet:group' elements, one that encloses a set of descendent elements (thereby forming an implicit 'descendant element' query) and two others that, although they enclose a set of descendant elements, also have an explicit query that will associate elements in the document with that group.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Elements that are members of the 'fooGroup' group will have their borders turned black, those that are members of the 'gooGroup' group will have their borders turned blue and those that are members of 'mooGroup' group will have their borders turned red.
    <br/>
    <!-- Since this element is not empty, its 'context' is itself and the implied query is '*' (i.e. all descendants) -->
    <tibet:group id="fooGroup">
        <div id="foo">This is the foo div. It is in the 'fooGroup' group.</div>
        <div id="bar">This is the bar div. It is in the 'fooGroup' group.</div>
    </tibet:group>

    <!-- Since this element is not empty, its 'context' is itself. Since a query is specified, only elements that match it *and that are under it* (because its the context) are considered part of the group. -->
    <tibet:group id="gooGroup" query=".gooThings">
        <div id="gar">This is the gar div. It is not in any group.</div>
        <div id="gaz" class="gooThings">This is the gaz div. It is in the 'gooGroup' group.</div>
    </tibet:group>

    <!-- Since this element is not empty, its 'context' is itself. Since a query is specified, only elements that match it *and that are under it* (because its the context) are considered part of the group. -->
    <tibet:group id="mooGroup" query="#maz, .mooThings &gt; *">
        <div id="mar">This is the mar div. It not in any group.</div>
        <div id="maz" class="mooThings">This is the maz div. It is in the 'mooGroup' group.</div>
        <span class="mooThings">
            <div id="moofy">This is the moofy div. It is in the 'mooGroup' group.</div>
            <div id="moogy">This is the moogy div. It is in the 'mooGroup' group.</div>
        </span>
    </tibet:group>
