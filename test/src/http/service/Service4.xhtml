    <h2>Service Test #4</h2><br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    This test sets up a &lt;http:service&gt; tag that services data at a particular URI. It shows how to perform a standard HTTP REST GET using a static REST-style parameter. It doesn't have a data type assigned, but will try to use a dynamically computed content type to hold the result data based on the data returned.
    <br/>
    A variety of signals are thrown by the various objects involved.
